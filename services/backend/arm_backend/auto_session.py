"""Phase 8: shared apply-session core + rip-complete auto-apply hook.

`apply_session_internal` is the engine behind both code paths:
  * `POST /api/jobs/{id}/transcode` — manual click in the UI.
  * `_maybe_auto_apply_session` — fired from `rip-complete` when the disc's
    drive has `default_session_id` set and `Config.auto_transcode_on_idle` is
    enabled.

Both paths emit a single `session.queued` WS event on success with the
`source` field set to `"manual"` or `"auto"` so the UI can render where each
in-flight transcode came from.

Auto-apply failures never bubble out: a deleted session, a template that
resolves to an empty token, or a path collision all log at WARN and let the
caller's HTTP response succeed unchanged. The user can still hand-apply the
session afterwards.
